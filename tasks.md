# AudibleMind - Task Tracking with status

## Project Overview
**AudibleMind** is an intelligent document processing application that transforms complex documents into digestible, interactive content through AI-powered explanations and text-to-speech conversion.

### Core Features
- PDF/document upload (20-25 pages)
- Paragraph-by-paragraph processing
- User-defined prompt customization
- AI-powered content explanation/simplification
- Text-to-speech conversion
- Interactive UI with navigation
- Step-by-step content presentation

### Example Use Case
When a user uploads "Attention is All You Need" paper:
1. Process first paragraph
2. Apply user prompt (e.g., "explain in simpler terms")
3. Generate simplified explanation
4. Convert to audio
5. Display text + audio on UI
6. Navigate to next paragraph
7. Repeat process
